Howdy!

I am {botname}! I am a completely configurable bot (much like AutoModerator) that manages flairs on a sub-wide basis. \
While I am setting up shop here, please take some time reading my documentation available at \
https://github.com/rDankMemes/DankFlairBot. I will not perform any actions until user configuration is complete.

*If you did not expect to receive this message, please contact /u/ELFAHBEHT_SOOP.*
